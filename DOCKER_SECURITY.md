# Docker Security Updates

## Snyk Vulnerabilities Resolution

### Issues Identified

- **SNYK-DEBIAN12-PAM-10378969**: Directory Traversal in `pam/libpam0g`
- **SNYK-DEBIAN12-ZLIB-6008963**: Integer Overflow in `zlib/zlib1g`

### Resolution Strategy

Migrated to Google's Distroless images for maximum security:

1. **Root Cause**: The vulnerabilities were in Debian 12 system packages used by base images
2. **Solution**: Switched to `gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12` which:
   - Contains only Python runtime and essential libraries
   - No shell, package managers, or unnecessary tools
   - Minimal attack surface (only what's needed to run Python)
   - Uses hardened, minimal Debian base with security patches
   - Runs as nonroot user by default

### Changes Made

- **Build stage**: `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim` (optimized for uv)
- **Runtime stage**: `gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12` (minimal runtime)
- **Security**: Removed shell access, package managers, and unnecessary tools
- **User**: Automatic nonroot user (no manual user creation needed)
- **Health checks**: Removed (no curl/shell available in distroless)

### Security Benefits

- ✅ **Minimal attack surface**: Only Python runtime and dependencies
- ✅ **No shell access**: Eliminates shell-based attacks
- ✅ **No package managers**: Can't install malicious packages at runtime
- ✅ **Hardened base**: Google-maintained security patches
- ✅ **Nonroot by default**: Runs with least privilege
- ✅ **Smaller image size**: Faster deploys, less storage

### Distroless Architecture

```text
Builder Stage (ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim)
├── UV pre-installed and optimized
├── Install additional build dependencies (libpq-dev)
├── Install Python dependencies with uv
└── Create necessary directories

Runtime Stage (gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12)
├── Copy Python packages from builder
├── Copy application code
├── Copy pre-created directories
└── Run as nonroot user
```

### Testing

After rebuilding with distroless base:

```bash
docker build -t testapp:scan-latest .
snyk test --docker testapp:scan-latest --severity-threshold=high
```

### Runtime Security

The distroless runtime image contains:

- ✅ Python 3.12+ runtime only
- ✅ Essential libraries (libc, libssl, etc.)
- ✅ CA certificates for HTTPS
- ❌ No shell (/bin/sh, bash)
- ❌ No package managers (apt, pip)
- ❌ No text editors or utilities
- ❌ No debugging tools
